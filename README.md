# Frozen Lake

This repository contains implementations for reinforcement learning strategies and neural network models for digit classification. The code also demonstrates the application of these methods to solve problems such as navigating the Frozen Lake environment.

## Overview

### Reinforcement Learning
- **Environment**: The code utilizes the OpenAI Gym's Frozen Lake environment to demonstrate reinforcement learning techniques.
- **Algorithms**: Includes implementations for value iteration and __Q-learning__, designed to find optimal policies for navigating through the environment with deterministic and stochastic transitions.

### Neural Networks for Digit Classification
- Utilizes TensorFlow to construct and train a neural network model.
- The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, aiming for high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits.
